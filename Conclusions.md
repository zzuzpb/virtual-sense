# Conclusions #

VirtualSense is the first prototype of a low-cost
open-hardware wireless sensor module which enables
the deployment of energy-harvesting wireless sensor
networks programmable in Java. Both the PCB
schematics and the list of hardware components can
be downloaded from [NeuNet](http://www.neunet.it/) web site.
The energy-efficiency of all the components, together
with the power management opportunities and with
the careful design of the architecture keep the overall
power consumption of VirtualSense between 1mW
and 60mW in active mode (depending on the
operating frequency of the MCU and on the activity of
the transceiver) and provide low-power states with
power consumption of about 10GW to be exploited
while waiting for external events.
